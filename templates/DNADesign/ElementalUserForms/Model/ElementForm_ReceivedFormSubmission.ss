!!! This template is intentionally empty !!!

ElementalUserForms replaces $Content with the contents of this template
when the form has been submitted. We don't want that, because
UserDefinedFormController_ReceivedFormSubmission.ss already provides the
"thank you" content, and we don't want to show it twice
